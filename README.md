# BHM_eLabFTW_BIDS_project
Repository aimed at exchanging and sharing ressources about the structuration of eLabFTW and BIDS usages throughout neuroscience laboratories

The aim is to share a set of methods, software and methodologies for managing data/metadata acquired under the BIDS principle.

- **The docs section** allows us to share documentation concerning the software/methods we use together.
